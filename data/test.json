Did Fuzzy Dice reject you? Want to examine ethics through the lens of a post-apocalyptic authoritarian commune? Audition forSAFE HARBOR!!!!(human-made collage of AI images)Here's the description:Safe Harbor is an original piece of interactive theater modeled after choose-your-own-adventure video games. The audience will be the protagonists/main players in a story where their choices have a real impact. The audience begins in a bomb shelter after nuclear armageddon, and they quickly realize there are not enough rations to survive. A missionary from a place called \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d welcomes audience members to escape certain death and join their community. Those who follow will find themselves a citizen of an authoritarian post-apocalyptic commune where they must balance liberty and security in a series of choices. This production will include audience interaction, a mix of scripted moments and improvisation, and creative collaboration from the cast/design team. It will be more fun than any one of us can handle.To audition sign up for a slot for Try on Theater on September 23 or 24https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0E4CAFAF2AA6FACF8-tryontheater#/If you have any questions or inquiries at all please email me atdjd3@princeton.edu!!!Content advisory: Xenophobia, Violence, Discussion of Suicide, Authoritarianism, Nuclear Armageddon, Mentions of Homophobia, Sexism, Forced Marriage, Possible Use of Darkness or Flashing Lights, Audience Interaction,Movement on the part of Audience MembersSchedule: Rehearsals will begin in mid-November (likely Nov.18 - Dec.6) for about 5-8 hrs/wk, then pick up again for an intensive last week of Wintersession, and continue 5-10 hrs/wk until tech.Tech: Feb. 5 - 8 (preliminary)Dress Rehearsals:\u00a0 Feb. 10 - 13 (preliminary)Performances:\u00a0 Friday Feb. 14th, Saturday Feb. 15th, Sunday Feb. 16thThis email was instantly sent to all\r\n\t\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\t\tEmail composed by Dominic J.

        "text": "Subject: Opioid Harm Reduction by UHS  - Get free Narcan\u00ae nasal spray and/or Fentanyl Test Kits\nFrom: University Health Services <hoagie@princeton.edu>\nBody: Campus survey data suggests that most undergraduate and graduate students don\u2019t use any kind of drugs unless they have a prescription. However, a small number do. While opioids by themselves can lead to overdose, a major contributor to the increase in drug overdoses in the U.S. over the past decade is illegally-made fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid. Fentanyl is often added to other drugs (including cocaine, MDMA, meth, and heroin) without the knowledge of the person using the drugs. Even pills that look like legitimate medicines or come from a friend/someone you trust may contain fentanyl if you did not get them at a licensed pharmacy.HavingNaloxone (Narcan\u00ae nasal spray)available can help to reduce the risk of an overdose in our community. If you or someone you know is using drugs, having access toFentanyl test stripsmay reduce the risk of unknowingly ingesting fentanyl.Narcan and Fentanyl Test Kits are available in thevestibule of McCosh Health Center 24/7.You can also sign uphereto receiveNarcan\u00ae nasal sprayORNarcan\u00ae and/or a Fentanyl TestKit containing test strips (and everything else you need except water) delivered to your Frist mailbox from University Health Services. The sign-up asks three simple questions to facilitate delivery to you.The information you submit will be private and will be deleted after the items have been mailed.\u00a0 Your request will not be linked to your health records and no record of your request will be kept.More about Fentanyl test strips andNaloxone:Fentanyl test stripsare small strips of paper that may detect the presence of fentanyl in all different kinds of drugs (cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, etc.) and drug forms (pills, powder, and injectables). Testing drugs for the presence of fentanyl and not using any drugs that test positive for fentanyl may help avoid its unintended use. It may not always eliminate the risk that fentanyl is present because a negative result is not a 100% guarantee that the drugs tested are completely free from synthetic opioids.Always have Narcan\u00ae available.The kit you will be sent contains everything you need to test drugs except for water.Naloxone, brand name Narcan\u00ae, is a life-saving medication thatcan reverse an overdose from opioids\u2014including heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid medications\u2014when given in time. Naloxone will not reverse overdose from other substances. Naloxone is safe to use for suspected overdose even if it turns out that opioids are not present.This email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by Kathy Wagner (akwagner@princeton.edu) \u2014 if you believe this email\r\n\tis offensive, intentionally misleading or harmful, please report it tohoagie@princeton.edu.",

We publish actual, physical books written by Princeton students. Each author gets their own book published\u2014Moon Press is not an anthology.Q: How many authors will be published?A: We are looking to select around 3 manuscripts, but this number is not a hard limit.Q: My project exceeds 60 pages, can I submit a 60-page excerpt of it?A: Your manuscript must be able to stand alone as its own book, so if you\u2019re able to pare down a longer project into 60 pages without it being incomplete, great! If not, no.Q: How are author/editor teams assigned?A: We are committed to finding the best fit for authors and editors alike \u2013 after finalizing the staff and authors, all members will get a say in which teams they might want to be a part of.Q: How frequent are meetings/what days do we meet/what\u2019s the schedule like?A: Aside from 1-2 press-wide meetings (for check-ins, housekeeping, etc), each individual team can largely decide their own meeting times and frequency depending on the members\u2019 schedules and needs.Q: Can I be an author AND a staff member/writing editor/art editor?A: If your manuscript is selected for publication, you\u2019ll already be heavily involved in the press through your own teams\u2019 meetings and the time you put in revising your own manuscript. As a staff member, you\u2019ll also be responsible for reading and workshopping another author\u2019s manuscript, and committing to those separate meetings.

The audience will be the protagonists/main players in a story where their choices have a real impact.

A missionary from a place called \u201cSafe\u00a0Harbor\u201d welcomes audience members to escape certain death and join their community. Those who follow will find themselves a citizen of an authoritarian post-apocalyptic commune where they must balance liberty and security in a series of choices.

Please let us know if you have any questions!\u200bOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Program on Science & Global Security (SGS), part of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, this special exhibition at the Bernstein Gallery confronts the existence and threat of nuclear weapons. It marks the first stop of a national university tour ofthe bomb, a multimedia installation by Smriti Keshari and Eric Schlosser (\u201981).Unfolding across forty-five screens,the bombimmerses viewers in the story of nuclear weapons, from the first nuclear test and subsequent use against Japan by the United States in 1945, to today\u2019s arms race. It illuminates the thousands of nuclear weapons\u2013\u2013held only by nine states\u2013\u2013on land, underground, and at sea, many ready for launch. Though largely hidden from view, these weapons pose an ever-present existential threat to humanity.Inspired by nuclear weapon command-and-control centers,the bomb\u2019s design evokes the technological fallibility of such systems, the devastating consequences of errors and malfunctions, and the inherent impossibility of ever fully controlling these machines.This email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by Fiona I.

Yet today, most of these applications provide little or no public verifiability. This talk will survey nearly ten years of work by the author on using cryptography to generate publicly verifiable randomness, including the development of verifiable delay functions and modern randomness beacon protocols based on them. It will also discuss the practical challenges in bringing these protocols into common use.Bio:Joseph Bonneau is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at New York University and a Research Partner at a16z crypto. His research focuses on applied cryptography and computer security. He earned BS and MS degrees from Stanford University and completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge, all studying computer science.
