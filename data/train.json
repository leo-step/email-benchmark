Sentient just raised an $85M seed round led by\r\nFounders Fund and has a Princeton-heavy team with Professor Viswanath in\r\nECE as one of the co-founders. Sentient enables community built AI models\r\nby developing technology to make Open Source Models (which anyone can\r\ncontribute to) monitizable, and an incentive system to reward contributors\r\nto these open source models. Fundamentally, Sentient is a protocol that\r\npushes forward open source foundation models through community\r\ncontributions. You can think of the product of this protocol as these\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now looking to hire 2 part time interns from Princeton who will be\r\nworking on product research (understanding AI developer needs, ways of\r\noperating) and AI - blockchain writing (thinking critically about the\r\nproblems in AI, and the intersection of AI and blockchain, and writing high\r\nquality pieces on this). This internship presents a great opportunity to\r\nget to work with some of the Sentient team which includes several people at\r\nthe top of their field across departments. The open roles are somewhat open\r\nended and you will have tasks within marketing, product research, business\r\ndevelopment, management and potentially engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills we are looking for:\r\n\r\n   - High critical thinking ability\r\n   - Familiarity with AI\r\n   - Familiarity with Blockchain\r\n   - Good at writing\r\n   - Experience building with AI\r\n   - Experience with hackathons\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ideal candidate is someone who thinks deeply about the world and the\r\nfuture. We encourage engineers and non-engineers to apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nApply here: https://forms.gle/9EXjHxJoy3mZMfUv5\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will start processing applications on Tuesday and from there will\r\nproceed on a rolling basis so apply as soon as you see this! Reach out to\r\nme with any questions and please cc ben@sentient.foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBen",

You may have read about a proposal put forth by an umbrella anti-Israel campus group calling for BDS \u2013 or divestment from the world\u2019s only Jewish majority state and the only democracy in the Middle East. For more background regarding BDS and the way it serves not as an instrument of peace, but rather as a vehicle of divisiveness and hate towards members of the Jewish community, feel free to readthis primerfrom the American Jewish Committee.Importantly,our letter, which I invite you to read and sign by clickingthis hyperlink, highlights the differing perspectives within even the Jewish community regarding Israeli politics, policies, and the current war. However, the letter underscores our unity in opposition to factually inaccurate attempts at making Israel a pariah state, including a complete ignorance in the BDS proposal of Hamas\u2019 October 7th attack and subsequent hostage taking, including of our fellow Americans.Your signature matters. Your voice matters. Let\u2019s come together in this difficult time to prove that there is no consensus at this university regarding divestment from Israel. This matter is far more complex than its proponents make it out to be, and you cannot underestimate the value that the Jewish community places on the alliance of our fellow community members.https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOlgxAQyG4SwAsAdLdZ4VxmWZkyq_fieq96I72XuHQW9CvMA/viewformMy best,Maximillian MeyerP.S.

Each cohort typically consists of a working group leader and five to eight council members.CLC\u2019s working groups take auniqueapproach to service by empowering students to be innovators and leaders in their communities. We do this by equipping council members with the tools and skills to bring projects to fruition.

We offer professionally-taught lessons, social\u00a0dances, and an annual ballroom competition.We understand that ballroom\u00a0dance can sound really intimidating, but trust me, PBDC is a fantastic way to learn!\u00a0Here are three reasons whyyoushould try ballroom dance:PBDC is probably the most accessible dance group on campus. Most members have little or no experience when they join and you don't need a partner (at lessons, partners regularly rotate).PBDC is a very good deal for learning how to dance. The competitive price for ballroom dance lessons is usually $50+ per lesson. Our dues are only $20 per semester. We also offer the first week of lessons each semesterfor\u00a0free.PBDC does not require tons of commitment. We only have two days of lessons per week. Members are not required to participate in the annual competition or attend socials (but they should -- both are fun!).Dues information will be provided after the first few practices, the dates of which have yet to be determined.If you're curious, want to try ballroom dance, or just have more questions, I will probably be at the Campus Rec Expo (Sept. 4, 7:30 PM - 9 PM) or send an email to pbdc@princeton.edu.Looking forward to meeting you,Wyndham FreemanPresident, Princeton Ballroom Dance ClubThis email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by Wyndham M.

All we ask is that it can be feasibly produced in a Princeton area setting and is relatively low-budget (AKA no car chases and/or explosions).Explain your vision usingthis proposal formbefore September 9, 2024. The Princeton Pictures Board will collaborate with you todevelop your concept into a fully-fledged short-film script before the final deadline on September 15, 2024, so, if you are unfamiliar with script writing or movie-making, do not be discouraged- we still want to hear your story!However, if you are feeling more ambitious, you can submit an already-written script usingthis form.The soft deadline for scripts is September 9, 2024 and the hard deadline remains at September 15, 2024.Submitting a script before the soft deadline allows you to revise it based on feedback from the Princeton Pictures Board before the 15th, giving your script an edge in the selection process when all scripts are reviewed Please refer to examples athttps://www.nfi.edu/examples-of-movie-script/to familiarize yourself with the format.Submission Guidelines:LengthPage count: Your story should be told in about 5 to 10 pages. 10 Pages is the absolute maximum; any scripts exceeding this limit will have a harder time being considered by the board.Budget ConstraintsLow Budget: The film must be feasible with a very limited budget. Please ensure your film can be produced affordably, keeping in mind costs for locations, props, and actors.Production Location:Filming Area: Your film should be feasible to produce in the Princeton area. Consider Locations that are accessible within this region and avoid scenes requiring elaborate sets or extensive travel.Content and Themes:Practicality: Write a piece that is practical to film with minimal resources. Simple settings, a small cast, and straightforward props are encouraged. Avoid complex special effects or stunts that could raise production costs.Originality: Try to think outside the box. What\u2019s a topic, theme, or tone that Princeton Pictures has not explored yet in its previous short films?Submission Format:Script format: Submit your final script in a standard screenplay format (e.g., Final Draft, PDF, Celtx, etc.).

Ready to tackle the obvious struggles that can come from an American doing business in China (namely language barriers and culture shock), Daniel doesn\u2019t realize that doing business in China is much more complex than he\u2019d hoped. Daniel\u2019s \u2018consultant\u2019, Peter, teaches him about \u201cguanxi,\u201d the system of social networks and influential relationships that facilitate business in China, and the two of them get started trying to create a relationship with Minister Cai. However, \u201cguanxi\u201d gets in Daniel\u2019s way and he needs to find another way in...that\u2019s when the Vice Minister Xi Yan steps in to save the day. Daniel forms a relationship with her and, as he follows her advice, he begins to fall in love. They learn to communicate in their own form of Chinglish, but also that some things aren\u2019t so easily translated. Unlike Daniel, Xi\u2019s after pleasure, not relationship, as she soundly rejecting Daniel's belief that sex leads to love and then to marriage...\u200bWe are currently seeking sign-ups for prospectivecastANDcrewmembers - auditions will be heldSeptember 9-11, from 5-7 PM in East Pyne 215.

We\u2019d especially like to welcome the Great Class of 2028 to their first year on campus, and we hope that FedSoc can become an important part of your time at Princeton!The Princeton Federalist Society is a group of conservative and libertarian students dedicated to studying and debating the Constitution. As stated by the national organization, we believe that \u201cthe state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.\u201d We also believe that the best way to approach, and explore, the deepest questions of constitutional importance is to debate them with prepared and insightful opponents. If you have a passion for the constitution, but also for robust debate, then FedSoc is just the place for you.In the past, we have hosted events with prominentscholars,jurists,commentators,philosophers, and evenbiologists. This semester, we plan to hold a number of equally-exciting events. Whether you are a conservative or liberal, an originalist or living constitutionalist, or even a judicial supremacist or departmentalist (come to FedSoc to learn more about these two!), there is a place for you at the Princeton Federalist Society. We will have a booth at the Whig-Clio activities fairtoday, Thursday, September 4th,and at the ODUS activities fairtomorrow, Friday, September 5th. Come visit us for stickers, pocket constitutions, and to sign up for our email list.

We understand that the need for these products presents a financial burden for a sizable portion of out student body and not having access greatly impacts a students health, dignity, and academic success.In 2017 we launched a pilot program, since 2018 we've been in policy discussions with administrators, and in August 2019 we began our 1st stage implementation. At the end of the 2022-23 spring semester we were granted approval for an expansion project to install menstrual product dispensers in even more academic buildings. Our goals for the future are to implement free menstrual products in residential buildings, to promote menstrual equity education on campus, and to expand our reach beyond the Princeton community.Join us, a diverse team of students of all backgrounds, in fighting for\u00a0menstrual\u00a0equity and help us\u00a0make the campus a more equitable and accessible home for all students!We are looking for passionate, creative, resourceful leaders to help bring this to life.

On annual national tours? As the only student group that plays at McCarter Theatre?Then...Audition for Triangle Pit!September 9-11!Sign up and find audition infoHERE!!Short solo (typically 3-5 minutes)Short sight-reading from a past Triangle ShowAnd,THIS FRIDAY (TOMORROW), come meet us and see us perform thebest songsfrom Triangle's133-year historyat our annualFrosh Week Show!TOO LITTLE, '28...@ McCarter Theatre, 7:30 and 10:00 pm shows, free & unticketedWHO WE ARE:We're the reason that Princeton's oldest theatre tradition is not a costumed, microphoned, well-lit, extremely confusing a capella group (you're welcome, Princeton). Check out our Instagram@princetontrianglepitto see what we're up too...WHAT WE DO:Under the intrepid leadership of a student conductor and filled to the brim of the stage with some of the best musicians on campus, the Pit accompanies the Triangle Frosh Week Show, Fall Show, National Tour, and Reunions Show. We get to originate parts on brand-new, student written music, so technically we're the ones who world-premier this music every year. Our orchestrators get to flex their creative arrangement muscles as far as they go - and usually, with the caliber and flexibility of musicians we have, that can go pretty far. We're the only Pit Orchestra on campus that performs in the McCarter Theatre, and therefore the only Pit Orchestra who gets to shout expletives throughout the Triangle Frosh Week show every year. Basically, in the Triangle Pit, you have impossible freedom: you can orchestrate a number, you can learn how to play four new instruments just for a series of two-bar increments - you can even play sports, if you really want.WHY JOIN:Without us, the Writers' songs can never come to life. We try not to hold this over their heads too much, but it does come in handy when you need someone to do your homework for a month if you'll just play that one sax solo a half step up. Triangle integrates its musicians into an overall club and production in a way that is extremely rare anywhere else on campus. There is something that brings musicians together about playing pantsless shows just for funsies and occasionally passing around an instrument on the Tour bus when that last guitar is just not fitting with the luggage. As a result of these uniquely entertaining opportunities, the Pit draws a unique community - musicians of all stylistic backgrounds join our fold, many of whom perform with other groups on campus such as PUO, CLE, PUWE, and Sinfonia. We've got about 16 members and usually start rehearsing three to four weeks before a show. We're chill; you'll like us.Email Pit Manager Ethan Mandojana '27 (em8431@princeton.edu) with any questions!See you soon\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3\u25b3Audition Form & Info:https://forms.gle/3RwXvC4F4KLjw3oe7This email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by Ethan R.

At the end of the 2022-23 spring semester we were granted approval for an expansion project to install menstrual product dispensers in even more academic buildings. Our goals for the future are to implement free menstrual products in residential buildings, to promote menstrual equity education on campus, and to expand our reach beyond the Princeton community.Join us, a diverse team of students of all backgrounds, in fighting for\u00a0menstrual\u00a0equity and help us\u00a0make the campus a more equitable and accessible home for all students!We are looking for passionate, creative, resourceful leaders to help bring this to life.

Embden\" <hoagie@princeton.edu>\nBody: Hello Princeton!We are still recruiting volunteers - especially in our Trenton campus! As stated in my previous email, tutors help non english-speakers in our community and connect with students to foster valuable relationships.Tutoring is conducted on Wednesday\u2019s in the Princeton campus (7-9pm) and Saturdays in Trenton (12-2pm). A training session for tutors will be conducted on 9/14 (likely 4-6pm).I would love to encourage you to consider tutoring in Trenton on Saturdays. Many of our students are unable to travel to Princeton, due to financial and scheduling reasons, so this is the only opportunity for some to learn English. Further, our Trenton campus is in a Safe Haven location, which means ICE presence is not allowed, making certain students feel more comfortable in their learning environment. I understand that traveling outside of campus on a Saturday is inconvenient, but we would appreciate your consideration of this opportunity so we can teach as many students and levels as possible!Please feel free to reach out with any questions and fill outthis google formif you\u2019re interested in tutoring (on either campus). If you'd like to learn more and meet other volunteers, come to SPEAR's open meeting tomorrow at 7pm at the Carl A Fields Center in the 101 Dickerson Lounge.This email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by Isabelle R.

This year, we are excited tooffer auditionees the opportunity to submit a videoof themselves performing any Latin dance style to our core team.Submitting a video is optional and not required; it is simply an additional option for those who have experience in regional, indigenous, or less widely known Latin dance styles. If you choose to send a video, it will be considered in discussionsonly if you are invited to callbacks. Much like the evaluation process for reggaeton during callbacks, submitting a videocan only help your audition, not hurt it. Similarly, not submitting a videowill not negatively impact your audition.QUESTIONSIf you have any questions, you don\u2019t know where the dance studios are, or want to request accommodations, feel free to contact our leaders:Victoria Caballero Quinn (President):vc6715@princeton.eduCatherine Ruiz (Vice President):cr5620@princeton.eduAngela Hernandez (Artistic Director):ah5095@princeton.eduAlanna Perez (Assistant Artistic Director):ap6312@princeton.eduWE HOPE TO SEE ALL OF YOU THERE THIS SATURDAYM\u00c1S LOVE<3This email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by Victoria Caballero Quinn (vc6715@princeton.edu) \u2014 if you believe this email\r\n\tis offensive, intentionally misleading or harmful, please report it tohoagie@princeton.edu.",

(Log into your NetId (not alias) and then search \u201cOctober 7\u201d in the events section to reserve your seat. If you have an alias, you might need to reach out to tixhelp@princeton.edu to book the tickets because of a system-wide problem.)Hi Princeton,B\u2019Artzeinu would like to invite you to attend an important play we are hosting in just under two weeks. Info about it below:October 7: In their Own Wordsis a play created by journalists Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhney after visiting Israel post-October 7. The play is a verbatim production, where the onlyspeech is the actual testimonies from October 7 survivors. The play has already debuted in New York City this May, and its run was very successful (see presscoveragehere,here,here,here,here,here, andhere). We are very fortunateto have the opportunity to put on such a production at Princeton, as we are one of only six universities in the country selected to host this production during their fall tour.There is a lot said about the current war in the Middle East, and much of it is editorialized on both sides. In particular, we in the B\u2019Artzeinu community are very concerned about the lack of knowledge about the events of October 7th that caused the current conflict we are all witnessing. Part of the reason we wanted to bring this production to campus is because its verbatim reproduction of survivors\u2019 testimony allows students to understand the truth of what happened on that terrible day without any editorializing \u2014 students can walk away with a better intellectual understanding of a very significant day in world history and world politics.As we approach the one year anniversary of the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, we hope that the Princeton community will take this opportunity to learn more about the events that transpired on that day, and thus, be more knowledgeable world citizens and Princeton students.To book tickets to this production,you\u2019ll need tologinto your NetID (not alias email), search \u201cOctober 7\u201d and then you should be able to reserve a spot. If you have any issues, you can reach out to tixhelp@princeton.edu and they should be able to sort it for you.As always, please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would just like to chat.Best wishes,Danielle Shapiro and Alex Ostrin, Presidents of B\u2019Artzeinu PrincetonAs we plan this event and continue with our regular lives, we continue to call for the return of all 101 people currently being held hostage in Gaza by the terrorist group Hamas. As Princeton students, we in particular are thinking about theseven American citizensstill stuck in the terror tunnels of Hamas. We also think about thetens of thousands of Israeli citizenswho have been displaced from their homes since October 7th because of continued attacks from Hezbollah, another terrorist group in the region. We continue to hope and pray for an end to the terror and for long-term peace for the region.This email was instantly sent to all\r\n\tcollege listservs withHoagie Mail. \r\n\tEmail composed by B\u2019Artzeinu (artzeinu@princeton.edu) \u2014 if you believe this email\r\n\tis offensive, intentionally misleading or harmful, please report it tohoagie@princeton.edu.",

Looking for aperformanceopportunity?Want to be involved in theinterrogationof a classic trope and even more classic of a story?Then, you should learn more aboutMacbeth in Stride!Description: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference \u2018tween what you\u2019re told and what you know?\u201d When we dissect and reassemble canonized narratives, what new stories emerge?Macbeth in Strideis a90 minute rock-pop-gospel-R&B musicalthat \u201cexamines what it means to be anambitious Black womanthrough the lens ofone of Shakespeare\u2019s most iconic characters.\u201d It preserves the madness, mystery, and macabre while infusing its own twist of irony, indulgence, and introspection.Character Descriptions:Woman - A Black woman: Ambition is both the cause of her rise to success and her eventual downfall. She occupies space sometimes as Lady Macbeth and other times as a critical modern eye on the narrative as it plays out.Man: Essentially the Scottish king himself. Anchored to the original plot and the way things have always been. But as the original plot descends into madness, so does the stoicism of his character.The Witches*: essentially act as the Woman\u2019s back-up chorus (but to them, that\u2019s a \u201ccharged term\u201d)First Witch: Honesty is her core value. She says what needs to be said when others won\u2019t, even if it requires her stepping outside of her role in the story and reaching out to the audience. All hail Woman and possibility!Second Witch: Grounded in reality. When we get a little too deep into the conjuring, myths, and magic, she\u2019ll be the first to burst the bubble. All hail us!Third Witch: Offers the unsaid and usually disregarded perspective. Not quite but close to the position of devil\u2019s advocate. All hail what\u2019s been written!A Band: quite literally the pit musicians (keys, drums, guitar, bass). We\u2019reallin the story.*All of the Witches should be cast as Black women.Interested?Sign up for a Try on Theater (TOT)slot from6-7:30pmor8-9:30pmon September 23 or 24 here!

What about performing in a jazzy, low-commitment, uber-suave house band? Does your performing arts or demonstration-based group want to come on our show? If any of these apply, fill out our non-bindinginterest form here!Who we are and what we do:All-Nighter is Princeton\u2019s first, premier, and only live late-night talk show. We produce a hour-long show 6 times/year in Frist Theater. Typically, our shows are scheduled for 10:45pm on Friday nights. Our 2024-2025 season is our 13th go-around, hosted by Isis Arevalo '25 and co-hosted by Alison Silldorff '25. Our show is complete with comedy sketches, guests, a performance from someone talented, and various nonsense and good times. You can peruse ourYouTube(@AllNighterPrinceton) andInstagram(@allnighterpton) to watch past sketches and get a sense of our show style.What you would do:We\u2019re proud of what All-Nighter has grown into. As a performer, you get to show off your artsy side in front of a full, excited audience (we\u2019re talking 250+ people\u2026) and contribute to a campus institution. Performing for All-Nighter is a super low-commitment gig,NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED!And best of all, theinterest formis non-binding. See descriptions for different show opportunities below.Acting:You can perform in ONE EPISODE per season as a sketch comedy actor. Typically, we take 5 actors per episode. This is a very low commitment opportunity, which will only take up about 1.5 weeks of your life (but provide you with lasting memories). No formal acting experience is required, just a sense of humor and a commitment to learn script lines with a short turnaround.Solo/Duo Musical Guest:You can perform in ONE EPISODE per season as a solo or duo musical guest (aka Big Ditty). We also allow bands! It\u2019s preferred if you can provide your own accompaniment and instruments. Original songs or covers are both acceptable.House Band Musician:If you play a jazz-adjacent instrument and are interested in performing in our house band alongside Music Director Simon Marotte, let us know! Our house band plays intro/exit music, transition music, and licks throughout the show. We even have a theme! We typically hold one rehearsal prior to each episode.Group Performances:If you are a leader of a performing arts or demonstration-based group on campus (you can get creative with your definition of \u2018demonstration\u2019), please reach out to our team directly or share your performance idea in the \u2018Other\u2019 tab on the interest form. To reach out directly about performance opportunities, please send an email to Gia Musselwhite (gmusselwhite@princeton.edu), Jackie Qin (jq7944@princeton.edu), AND Simon Marotte (sm0891@princeton.edu) with [All-Nighter] in the subject line.Tech:We also have some floating tech team opportunities available, including lighting board-operation and videography for our live shows.
